YOUR SPARKLY NEW DEVICE CHECKLIST!

So you are going to build something? AWESOME. I am super proud of you and happy to help!
You can always message me with questions, and this little guide will (hopefully) help
you to get all the info you need and think about your device so you can get it prototyped
as fast as possible!

Let's get to it:

This first section is to help you identify the basics of your device. Much like a choose your 
own adventure, while there are some "hard and fast" rules to smart devices, the reeality is that you
have a lot of control about how and what you want to do. This questionaire section will help
you create a nice roadmap for your project and help guide you through the research stage of the
C.R.A.P. model.

- What are you going to measure?
    - Are you measuring more than one thing at the same time with this device?
        - Do you need to?
        - Do you have other devices capturing the same data nearby?
        - Is that data critical to this devices' function?
